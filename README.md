```python
from diffusion_forcing_transformer import HistoryGuidedDiffusion

# Initialize the HistoryGuidedDiffusion model
model = HistoryGuidedDiffusion()

# Load your input images
input_images = ...

# Generate videos using the model
generated_videos = model.generate_videos(input_images)

# Save or display the generated videos
...
```

## ü§ñ Model Architecture

The "History-Guided Video Diffusion" model leverages a combination of diffusion models, transformer networks, and history-guided mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art results in video generation tasks. The architecture is designed to capture long-range dependencies and temporal coherence in generated videos.
